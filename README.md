Hi 👋🏽, I'm Chaunda Dallas
a Cybersecurity Data Analyst, I am driven by my love for solving problems and my desire to make a positive impact through technology. Before transitioning to this field, I worked as a nurse for several years, where I honed my critical thinking skills and developed a dedication to helping others. I am a collaborative team player and thrive in environments where I can work with others to find innovative solutions to complex problems. Leveraging my passion for learning and problem-solving has led me to a career in cybersecurity, where I am constantly faced with new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
